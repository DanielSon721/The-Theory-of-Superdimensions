# The Theory of Super Dimensions

### A theory about the intersection of physics, astronomy, and statistics.

## By Daniel Son

If the fourth dimension exists, we would see objects phase in and out of existence.

e.g. 4th dimensional objects passing through our 3rd dimension which we see as 3D cross sections.

So why haven’t we? If the fourth dimension exists, we surely would have seen a phenomenal object phasing in and out of existence by now. And I’m not talking about quantum physics. I’m talking about a full-blown visible 3D cross section of an object.

But maybe it really is that rare. Let’s bring it down one notch to the second and third dimension. We as humans living in the third dimension pass through infinite layers of 2D planes every day. So these 2D worlds see things from the third dimension pass through their world all the time. Or do they? Perhaps there exists a 2 dimensional world in a 2 dimensional solar system in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Perhaps Idaho. Where literally nothing happens. Or a random spot in the sky. Or perhaps, it exists on a random plane in outer space.

Now let’s bring it back to 3D and 4D. Where does our Earth reside in the universe? Literally a single point in a vast, expansive universe. So statistically, maybe it really is that rare; at least to us measly humans, who have only existed for a few million years (puny on the universal scale) on a single planet Earth out of 8 in our solar system which is one out of countless solar systems in our Milky Way galaxy, which in turn is one of trillions of galaxies in the OBSERVABLE universe.

Asteroid collisions are common within the universe. But have you personally seen one? Exactly. Because a common occurrence in the cosmic world is a not so common occurrence in the human world.

And don’t even get me started on time. Time works weird, and maybe our 14 billion year old universe has only existed for mere milliseconds in the 4D world. Not long enough for something to have passed through our observable universe.

When you look at it this way, the fact that we haven’t seen a 4D object pass through our 3D world doesn’t seem so likely.

So if the 4th dimension does exist, how can we observe it? We need time and space. Lots and lots of it. The larger the sample size, the more likely we are to observe a rare phenomenon.

We would need to observe intergalactic space for trillions, maybe even quadrillions of years. Probably longer.

I think the fourth dimension exists. Science says there’s no evidence of it, but I just don’t think we’ve looked far and long enough.

Mathematically speaking, there’s no reason for existence to stop at the third dimension. At least not that we know of. Maybe there’s a limiting factor similar to how there are only 3-4 trophic levels in an ecosystem due to instability at higher trophic levels. That’s why this is just a theory.

So here’s my hypothesis:

If we observe every corner of the 3-dimensional universe for an infinite amount of time, we will eventually see an object phase in and out of existence — a 4D object passing through our 3rd dimension.

Edit: this can apply to the 5th, 6th, …, Xth dimensions
